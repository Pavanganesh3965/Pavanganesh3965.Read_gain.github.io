Inspiration
In the modern world, people often prioritize their mobile devices over fundamental needs such as food, sleep, and overall health. Unfortunately, addiction has become increasingly prevalent, whether it be to phones, web series, video games, smoking, alcohol, or sexual content. This excessive reliance on dopamine-inducing activities has led individuals to crave increasingly intense and visual content, causing them to overlook the inherent capabilities of their own brains and their creative imagination, which no film or web series can truly match. The main objective is to cultivate healthier habits. Consider asking students a simple question: What do they prefer, watching web series overnight or dedicating an hour to reading a book? Undoubtedly, most would choose the former. We are gradually training our brains to seek immediate pleasures that result in a quick dopamine release, rather than encouraging the development of reading habits. Our goal is to inspire individuals to invest time in reading books that capture their interest, dedicating an hour or two to the activity. At the end of each book, they will write a summary encompassing their learnings, favorite quotes, and visual experiences, providing valuable insights and motivating other readers. As a reward for fostering a healthy reading habit, we will offer a modest contribution to encourage them to continue their reading journey and contribute to a thriving community.

What it does
We have encountered numerous challenges when searching for specific books in the library, especially during exams. The unavailability of these crucial resources poses a significant problem for students who rely on them. It's disheartening to witness students neglecting regular reading and only resorting to it during exam time. We must contemplate the kind of engineers and professionals we are shaping when knowledge is consumed overnight. To address this issue, we propose granting students access to the library books online, allowing them to explore books that may have complex language or concepts. In turn, they can write summaries or explain the topics in simpler terms, sparking interest in other readers and encouraging them to delve into those books. By implementing this approach, we aim to make daily reading a seamless habit for every student, fostering a culture of contribution to the VIT student community. No one should face an exam without having read a book, and investing time in daily reading can alleviate the last-minute pressure. Our strategy involves breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, providing benefits to each and every VIT student.

How we built it
With the aid of VS code software and the Editor X platform, we embark on a journey to construct a captivating website. This platform will enable us to craft an exquisite UI/UX design, resembling the existing e-learning platforms. However, we aspire to go beyond the conventional features by incorporating additional functionalities. Users will have the opportunity to write comprehensive summaries on various topics, enriching the overall learning experience. Moreover, we will introduce a contributions section where users can upload their summaries as proof of their engagement. To incentivize and appreciate their efforts, we will reward users with a modest monetary compensation or offer them profile upgrades on our website. This enhancement will enable others to connect with these knowledgeable individuals, seek guidance, engage in debates, or clarify any queries they may have based on the shared summaries. The amount of compensation will be based on the time invested in reading books, assessed through the number of pages read and verified through screen records. By intertwining technology and incentivization, we hope to create a remarkable platform that fosters a love for reading and knowledge acquisition. In the pursuit of knowledge, individuals may reach a point where they feel content with the wisdom they have acquired. At this juncture, we encourage them to contribute to our vibrant society, for it is through collaboration that we can achieve remarkable feats. By partnering with esteemed libraries and organizations, we aim to expand our literary horizons and make a substantial contribution to the world of books. Together, we can bring forth an abundance of diverse knowledge and nourish the minds of countless individuals. Through this collective effort, we forge a path towards enlightenment, enriching our society with an ever-growing collection of invaluable books.

Challenges we ran into
Collaborating with the libraries of renowned organizations: By forming partnerships with prestigious libraries, we can tap into their vast collection of books, providing users with access to a diverse range of knowledge and resources. This collaboration allows us to offer a comprehensive and enriching reading experience.
Obtaining author's permission: Respecting the intellectual property rights of authors is of utmost importance to us. Before incorporating any book or content into our platform, we will diligently seek permission from the respective authors, ensuring that their work is recognized and properly attributed.
Securing funding for the initial stages: To establish a robust platform and bring our vision to life, securing adequate funding is crucial. We will explore various avenues such as grants, partnerships, or crowdfunding to secure the necessary resources for development, maintenance, and expansion.
Implementing plagiarism detection for summaries: Maintaining the integrity of the content on our platform is paramount. To ensure originality and prevent plagiarism, we will employ robust plagiarism detection tools. This will help us maintain a high standard of quality and authenticity in the summaries contributed by our users.
Managing and maintaining servers: As our platform grows and attracts a larger user base, it is essential to have reliable and efficient server infrastructure. We will allocate resources to establish and maintain powerful servers capable of handling high volumes of traffic, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted access to our platform for users worldwide. By addressing these key points, we can establish a strong foundation for our platform, guaranteeing a seamless and enriching experience for readers while upholding the principles of intellectual property rights, quality control, and sustainable infrastructure.
